## Description

I made a Weather Dashboard.

When the user loads the application, the user is presented with an text input field and a "Submit" button. When the user types in a city into the input field and clicks the "Submit" button, the current weather conditions and a five day forecast is displayed.

The current weather displays: The city name, the current date, an icon representing the current weather, current temperature in farenheit, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index's span is colored based on how high the UV index is.

The five day forecast displays five cards with the next five days' weather conditions, including: the date, an icon representing the weather, temperature in farenheit, humidity, and the wind speed.

When a city is searched, a button with the city name is made. This is the user's city search history. The user may look up cities' weather conditions they have searched before with one click.

## Other Comments

This was a great assignment for helping me understand how to use APIs, especially the Open Weather Map API. I feel there is still a lot for me to learn in terms of API. I have tried with my project team to figure out how to use other APIs, and it seems this assignment was just the tip of the iceberg.

I was able to figure things out on my own for the most part, but I attended one study group, and my peers were able to help me a lot, especially in one particular concept I could not figure out. I was able to figure it out with their help. As always, I feel very fortunate to be part of this class.

Enjoy.
